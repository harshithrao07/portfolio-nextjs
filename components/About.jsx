                <p className="mb-3">
                    I'm currently a fourth-year student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at NMAM Institute of Technology (NMAMIT). My main passion lies in web development - it's where I thrive and continuously explore. I bring innovation and leadership to the table when needed, but I'm also a dependable team player.

                <p>
                    Beyond the academic realm, you'll often find me immersed in video games, keeping up with my fitness routine at the gym, enjoying shows and anime, listening to music or working on intriguing web projects. Maintaining that balance between work and play is key, don't you think? ðŸ˜Š
